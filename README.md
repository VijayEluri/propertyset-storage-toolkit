## Description
The toolkit is a set of utilities to access, look up and store [OpenSymphony's PropertySet](http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset/) data. The thing is - no one really knows what's the best and the most painless process to store JIRA items configuration, let's say for your **__plug-in A__** at both plug-in and Project levels.
The purpose and the intent of this project is to provide You as Plug-in developer with the toolkit and ready to use samples and snippets to choose from to make thing work. 

As the project name states - it uses PropertySet as underlying storage implementation. It might not be the best choice for every plug-in out there in the wild world, still it's rather usable for most use cases I had so far.
