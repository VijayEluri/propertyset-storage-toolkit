## Description/Features
The toolkit is a set of utilities to access, lookup and store [OpenSymphony.com PropertySet][http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset/] data. The thing is - no one really knows what's the best and the most painless process to store Jira items configuration, let's say for your **__plugin A__** at both plugin and Project levels.
The purpose and the intent of this project is to provide You as Pludin developer with the tookit amd ready to use samples and snippets to choose from to make thing work. 

As the project name states - it uses PropertySet as underlying storage implementation. It might not be the best choice for every plugin out there in the wild world, still it's rather usable for most use cases I had so far.
